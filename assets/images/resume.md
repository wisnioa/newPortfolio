Essay 1

Despite the love of all tech from a young age, I like how programming marries the best of both worlds: problem solving and creativity. With some lines of code, you can build practically anything you wish, something fun and entertaining, or useful and productive. Only your creativity and patience are the limits. Creativity aside, programming at its core, solves problems. Computers do a rapid series of calculations over the course of their lives, and when we program using them, these computer calculations help solve many of the world's problems like finding directions to a place, long-distance communication, and so on. 

Essay 2
My evolution to becoming a software engineer began in college. I took an Intro to Online Journalism class where we each at to make a blog and website. The whole process fascinated me. After I graduated college, I took a web design course at a local community college to get my feet wet. After gaining employment at my current company, I took advantage of their company-sponsored education program and received my master's in Interactive Media. The graduate program that I participated covered more extensive topics like content management systems, JavaScript, video-editing, and so on. Deciding that I needed to extend my overall knowledge of programming, I moved from Connecticut to Texas to study at the University of Texas at Austin's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I see this opportunity to become a member of the LEAP program as a way to further increase my exposure to programming and the day-to-day responsibilities of being a web developer.
